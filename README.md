# Projects for Data Analyst Role

**This repo is created to show case my Dashboard building, Reporting, Data Storytelling, Data Analysis skills to potential Employers**

Data Analyst who is always willing to go the extra mile. Seeking to apply proven leadership, data analysis, security best practices, and coding skills to meet business requirements. I am familiar with the waterfall model as well as agile processes.

I am convinced that data analytics is a powerful way of thinking about data rather than a separate industry. Rapid advances in AI and ML are not destroying jobs; rather, they are forcing us to think outside the box in order to stay relevant in the industry.

I've solved a number of business problems/case studies with Python (machine learning), Excel (pivot tables), Tableau (relevant KPI dashboards), and SQL (Database). I'm always looking for new ways to solve complex problems. I believe in re-framing problems when necessary.

Meanwhile, I am pursuing a postgraduate degree in data science and have been accepted into a data science internship programme provided by TCR. 

I'm also interested in producing technical writing; here are a few examples.
