# AirBnB Storytelling

Airbnb's revenue has dropped dramatically in recent months. Airbnb wants to make certain that it is fully prepared for this change now that restrictions have begun to be lifted and people have begun to travel more.

You have been asked to analyse a dataset containing various Airbnb listings in New York in order to prepare for the next best steps that Airbnb should take as a business. Based on this analysis, you must make two presentations to the following groups.

1. Data Analysis Managers and Lead Data Analysts
2. Head of Acquisitions and Operations in New York City, as well as Head of User Experience in New York City
